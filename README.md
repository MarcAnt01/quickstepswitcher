This repo hosts the code of a modified Quickswitch version by [MarcAnt01](https://github.com/MarcAnt01).

It justs allows installation on OnePlus 3/3T, by removing device check. The module will cause bootloop if running Dirty Unicorns Rom (reason why the installation on OP3/3T has been blocked by the developers in official module), but is fine on other Roms; that's why I decided to make these changes.

Full credits to Quickswith authors. Check [here](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/quickstepswitcher) their original README.
